# dji_srt_to_ros_msg
This package contains python scripts to convert the telemetry of a DJI Drone (e.g. Mavic Mini) to ROS messages that may be used for robotic applications.
As the telemetry belongs to a video file and is pre-recorded, it is advised to record a bagfile of the messages for multiple use.
